Tips: 
Cyline has a three hit Saber combo she can execute by standing on the ground and mashing the Saber button!
She can also do a saber attack while crouching and in the air.
When Cyline is dashing and jumps she has better airspeed!

Some of the smaller fireballs can be destroyed if you hit them with the saber attack

Hit Priority:
There's a system called hit priority that determines how you can combo your attacks. Every attack has it's own priority, and as long
as the next move you use in a combo has a priority higher than the last, you'll damage the boss through it's invinciblity. The basic saber combo works because
each strike has a higher priority than the last one.
